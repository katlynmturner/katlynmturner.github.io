        <p>Katlyn M. Turner is a researcher, traveler, educator, and creator who focuses on technology,
environmental and climate justice, marginalized communities, and self determination. She has
led & conducted research on topics like critical minerals x AI, frontline communities and
storytelling sovereignty, the theory & practice of inclusive innovation, epistemic & institutional
exclusion in the nuclear sector, and climate justice praxis in sub-Saharan Africa. Her theoretical
frameworks about technology and social hierarchy aim to make visible the externalities of
technology systems and the ways in which intersectionally marginalized groups are uniquely
impacted; they are frequently cited in Black feminist, HCI, STS, and systems engineering
communities. Her work has been featured in large venues like climate week, The Conference,
and COP, and intimate ones like Racism and the Origins of the Atomic Bomb and the
Indigenous and Antiracist Innovators Summit. Katlyn earned her PhD from Stanford University
advised by the late Prof. <a href = "Put link here and copy this pattern for others">Rodney C. Ewing</a> and Prof. <a href = "Put link here and copy this pattern for others">Wendy Mao</a>>. Katlyn is a research affiliate at the MIT Media Lab and the CU Boulder Information Science Department, and is the founder and
principal investigator of KTLN Consulting. When not doing research-y things, you can find her
hiking with her dog Ru, at the City Park farmerâ€™s market, biking (outside or in dark rooms), or on
a train in Europe somewhere.</p>
